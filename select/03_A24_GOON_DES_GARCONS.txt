I been scheming for a long time
Now they know what's up
I was screaming from my home town
I don't give a fuck
Dreaming on my own cloud
I can't pass the blunt
My life is a movie now i can't make this up
In my me time I spend my free time overseas
Brotherhood of traveling pants
I'm rocking foreign jeans
I don't speak about my life
My life it speak for me
If you think you got it figured out
You only got a peak
Wes Anderson, zoom, hit my close up
I'm a star moved to Hollywood and I ain't
Even have a car i'm 'bout working smart
I am not 'bout working hard
I can tell you stories but
The real thing more bizarre
Lights, camera, action
Are you ready for the main attraction?
Suicide doors, it's tragic take a picture
What you here for? It'll last you
I been scheming for a long time
Now they know what's up
I was screaming from my home town
I don't give a fuck
Dreaming on my own cloud
I can't pass the blunt
My life is a movie now i can't make this up
Movie started playing soon as I
Came out the womb
You could ask my parents, they knew
They was in the room lights, camera
Action 'till the day I got a tomb
'Till then I'm driving foreign
Whips, now tell me, What's the move?
Ten-thousand people in the crowd goin' crazy
I was being nice but now I'm way too lazy
To try to give a fuck now
Unless you finna pay me
I'm a fuckin' brat
Shout out everyone who made me
Lights, camera, action
Are you ready for the main attraction?
Suicide doors, it's tragic take a picture
What you here for? It'll last you
I been scheming for a long time
Now they know what's up
I was screaming from my home town
I don't give a fuck
Dreaming on my own cloud
I can't pass the blunt
My life is a movie now i can't make this up
